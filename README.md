# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the rideshare data from January to early May 2019 and create a compelling visualization.The project use a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using python, Pandas and Matplotlib. And finally the project put three recommendations on what need to be done based on the on the outcome of the analysis.
# Result
Looking at the table below, total tides in urban is 1625 during jan,2019 to may 2019. On the contrary its only 125 rides in the rural area. Total drivers numbers also shows the difference between the rural, suburban and urban areas. The number of drivers in urban area is 3000% higher than the number of drivers in rural areas. This and possible other reasons contributed for the average very high fare per driver. Such as 335% higher in rural area than in urban area. Average fare per ride is $30.97 in Suburban area while in Rural $34.62 and $24.53 in Urban.

# Summary
The above analysis on table and the visualization of the ride share by city type shows the total fare, total ride and the total drivers in urban areas are much larger than in the Suburban and Rural areas. While average fare per ride and per driver in rural and suburban higher than in the urban areas.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on our analysis to address the disparities between the cities we recommend the CEO of PyBer Ride Sharing company to:
 1.	Increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas.
 2.	Decrease the average fare per ride in both Rural and Suburban areas.
 3.	Decrease the average fare per driver in both Rural and Suburban areas.
