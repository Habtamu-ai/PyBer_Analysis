# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the rideshare data from January to early May 2019 and create a compelling visualization.
The project uses a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. And finally, the project put three recommendations on what needs to be done to address any disparities among the city types based on the outcome of the analysis.

# Result
Looking at the table below, the total number of rides in urban is 1625 from Jan 2019 to May 2019. On the contrary, it is only 125 rides in the rural area and 625 in suburban. The total driver's column also shows the available number of drivers difference in the rural, suburban and urban areas. The number of drivers in the urban area is 3000% higher than the number of drivers in rural areas. This and possibly other reasons might have contributed to the averagely very high fare per driver in rural and suburban areas. Such as 335% higher in the rural area than in urban area. And average fare per ride in the rural area is  $34.62 while $30.97 and $24.53 in Suburban and urban areas respectively.

In the chart below we also see a line chart that shows the total fare by the city for every week. Looking at the chart the total fare is much larger in urban areas compared to suburban and rural areas. The result shows consistent differences throughout all weeks that the analysis considers.

# Summary
The above analysis on the table and the chart of the rideshare by city type show the total fare, the total ride and, the total drivers in urban areas are much larger than in the Suburban and Rural areas. While the average fare per ride and per driver in rural and suburban areas higher than in the urban areas.

## Recommendation

Based on our analysis to address the disparities between the city types we recommend the CEO of PyBer Ride Sharing company to:
 1.	Increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas.
 2.	Decrease the average fare per ride in both Rural and Suburban areas.
 3.	Decrease the average fare per driver in both Rural and Suburban areas.
